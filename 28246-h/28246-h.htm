<h2><a name="THE_TWINS" id="THE_TWINS"></a>THE TWINS.</h2>

<p>Young bears have always been great favorites as pets, being playful and
affectionate when kindly treated. They can be trained to perform all
kinds of amusing tricks; and their antics when playing together or with
children are very laughable. They have been taught to execute difficult
parts in theatrical displays; among other things, to ring bells, pretend
to fall dead when shot at, beat the drum, and go through the manual
exercise of the soldier with the musket.</p>

<p>But though playful and harmless when young, they can not be trusted when
their teeth and claws are full grown. Then their good nature can not be
counted on; and many instances have occurred in which they have repaid
friendly confidence with sudden treachery. It must be said in their
favor, however, that their wildness is often the result of bad treatment
or thoughtless teasing. There is a story in print of a planter in
Louisiana who once picked up a young cub that had either been abandoned
by its mother, or had run away from the parental den. He carried it home
and threw it down in the yard, where it was immediately adopted by the
little negroes. It became a great favorite with them, sharing their
corn-bread, and taking part in all their sports. "Billy"&mdash;that was the
name given to him&mdash;thrived and grew large and stout, and learned to box
and wrestle with the boys so well that visitors to the plantation were
always entertained with these droll exhibitions.</p>

<p>But one day, in the spring, when he had been about a year in captivity,
Billy was detected in making free with the young cabbages in the garden.
A stout negro man picked up a branch of rose-bush, and gave the marauder
a playful stroke. Filled with rage, Billy sprang upon the man, shook him
as if he had been a bundle of straw, and bit the poor fellow so severely
that he died. Billy was at once shot. A pet that could not control his
temper better than that was considered rather too dangerous to keep.</p>

<p>In a wild state, when in distress, young bears utter cries like those of
a child in trouble. During an overflow of the Mississippi the
inhabitants of a plantation were alarmed by the dreadful wailings, as
was supposed, of some children in a swamp. After a careful search two
little cubs were found in the hollow of an old tree, locked in each
other's arms. The mother bear had been drowned or shot, and these funny
little "babes in the woods" were crying with fright and hunger, and
appeared to welcome the protection of man with real joy.</p>

<p>Bears are very fond of whiskey and other kinds of strong drink, and when
intoxicated will act very much like a man in a similar condition.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE BRAVE SWISS BOY.</h2>

<h3><i>IV.&mdash;A TERRIBLE FALL.</i></h3>

<p>For a moment father and son stood silent on the brink of the crevasse,
looking after the chamois.</p>

<p>"We can't get across here, father," said Walter, in a whisper; "let us
try and find some other way."</p>

<p>"We can't find a better spot than this," replied his father, examining
his gun.</p>

<p>"But what's the use of shooting him? What's the good of a dead chamois
if we can't get him?"</p>

<p>"When he's once dead, boy, we'll soon find some means of getting at
him," was the answer. "A board laid over the crevasse will be an easy
way of recovering the venison."</p>

<p>"But we haven't got a board, father."</p>

<p>"That we'll see about. Just stand on one side, Watty."</p>

<p>The hunter cocked his gun, took aim for a moment, and was going to fire,
when he turned suddenly pale, and dropped his arm.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, father? Do you feel ill?" inquired Walter, with
anxiety.</p>

<p>"No," replied the huntsman; "but it seemed as if the ice was giving way
just as I was going to fire. But it can't be," he continued, stamping
his foot; "the ice is solid and firm enough."</p>

<p>"Let us go home, father," implored Walter. "I feel a presentiment that
something will happen. Come home now, and we can try for the buck
to-morrow."</p>

<p>But the old mountaineer had in the mean time become self-possessed
again, and again raised his gun to fire. Just as he pulled the trigger,
however, his foot slipped, and with an exclamation of horror, Walter saw
him carried rapidly toward the rift in the ice, and suddenly disappear.
With the recoil of the gun the hunter had lost his balance on the
slippery ice, and at the same moment that his shot struck the chamois,
he was hurled into the "rift."</p>

<p>"Father! father! father!" screamed Walter, throwing himself on the ice,
horror-stricken, and peering wildly down the crevasse. "Father, speak!"</p>

<p>All was silent. Only a slight trickling, as if from some subterranean
stream, reached his ear.</p>

<p>For several minutes the youth lay at the edge of the chasm, paralyzed
with terror. When he recovered his consciousness, a feeling of alarm and
distress overwhelmed him. He wept, and wrung his hands bitterly.</p>

<p>"Father!" he cried again into the abyss that yawned beneath
him&mdash;"father, speak to me, for God's sake!"</p>

<p>A sudden thrill passed through his frame as a low murmur came up from
the icy grave. He strained his ears to listen to the broken words. "I am
alive, Watty," was the reply of the unfortunate man; "but my ankle is
out of joint, and one of my arms broken. I shall never see the light of
day again."</p>

<p>A cry of mingled joy and agony burst from Walter's lips.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid, father," he exclaimed. "You shall be rescued, with
God's help. Have you got your bag with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but my bottle is broken."</p>

<p>"Well, then, take mine. I'll lower it down with a cord. Have you got
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was feebly answered. "I can hold out now for a while, unless the
cold strikes me."</p>

<p>"Courage, father, till I run down to the village, and get the neighbors
and shepherds to come with ropes and poles. Try to hold out for a couple
of hours, and with the help of God you shall be saved."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, dear boy," was the faint reply; "I will try to be patient till
you come back." And with a godspeed Walter hurried off to rouse the
neighbors to the rescue.</p>

<p>It was a dangerous journey that the brave boy undertook for his father's
rescue; but courage, and the agility which is acquired by those who are
accustomed to the mountains from childhood, enabled him to reach the
valley in a wonderfully short time. Pale as death, with hands bleeding,
and clothes torn to shreds, he rushed to the inn, which was the nearest
spot where help could be found. His appearance naturally created
consternation, and in answer to the numerous questions addressed to him
he related in a few breathless words the dreadful accident which had
befallen his father. A score of stalwart hands were instantly ready to
rescue the unfortunate man from his dreadful position; the landlord of
the inn ordered ropes, poles, and ladders to be got in readiness, and
meanwhile pressed refreshment on the well-nigh exhausted youth. Moments
were precious, but ere long the party reached the scene of the disaster,
when Walter, leaning over the edge of the cleft, cried to his father,
and was answered.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm still alive," replied the mountaineer, in feeble tones; "but I
am almost frozen to death, and in dreadful pain. Make haste and help me,
if you can, for I'm losing my senses."</p>

<p>"Down with the rope!" shouted the landlord, who had himself come up with
the party.&mdash;"Look out, Hirzel! Place the loop over your shoulders and
under your arms, and try to draw it tight. There are plenty of strong
arms here that will soon get you up."</p>

<p>The rope having been made fast to an iron stanchion driven into the ice,
the looped end was lowered away into the chasm; but no sign was made by
Hirzel that he had obeyed the directions, and fastened it round his
body.</p>

<p>"Father, why don't you make haste?" exclaimed Walter in agony.</p>

<p>But there was no answer.</p>

<p>"He must have fainted at the last moment," said the landlord; "and if
so, then may God have mercy upon him! for not a living creature could
venture such a depth."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 353px;">
<img src="images/ill_003.jpg" width="353" height="500" alt="&quot;LET ME GO!&quot; HE CRIED. &quot;I MUST SAVE MY FATHER!&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;LET ME GO!&quot; HE CRIED. &quot;I MUST SAVE MY FATHER!&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"<i>I</i> will venture it!" exclaimed Walter, seizing the rope. But twenty
hands held him back. "Let me go!" he cried. "I must save my father!" and
breaking loose with a sudden effort from the men who surrounded him, the
courageous youth seized the rope and disappeared in sight of his
horror-stricken companions.</p>

<p>A few terrible moments passed, when a shout from below was suddenly
heard, and the cry, "All right! pull away, friends!" sent a thrill of
joy through every heart.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pull steadily, my men," cried the good landlord; "but pull as if your
own lives depended on it. I can see them now!" exclaimed he, gazing into
the gloomy abyss. "Hirzel seems to have fainted, just as I thought, but
Watty has fastened the rope round him securely. Pull away! they will be
at the top in a few seconds."</p>

<p>Encouraged by success, the men redoubled their efforts, and had soon the
satisfaction of landing father and son safely on the ice.</p>

<p>A rough kind of stretcher having been hastily made of poles and ropes,
the wounded hunter was laid upon it and carried home; and as there was
no lack of stout hearts and sure feet, the journey was accomplished
without accident. After setting his broken limbs and binding up his
wounds, the doctor, who had been speedily called in, expressed the hope
that Hirzel's life would be saved, but he doubted very much if he would
ever be able to climb the mountains for chamois again. Walter was
thankful to find that his father's life was in no danger, and had
himself so far recovered his equanimity as to be able to relate how he
had rescued him from his icy grave, and how he found that the rope,
instead of having reached the wounded man, had actually rested on a
ledge ten feet above the place where he lay. Walter, who felt devoutly
thankful that his efforts had been so successful, was overwhelmed with
praises for his heroism.</p>

<p>Nor was the chamois forgotten. The generous landlord had it brought down
to the inn from the spot where it had fallen, and sent an ample
equivalent to Hirzel's cottage.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_PROFESSOR_ON_TWINKLING" id="THE_PROFESSOR_ON_TWINKLING"></a>THE PROFESSOR ON TWINKLING.</h2>

<p>Jack was delighted with the idea. Gus differed from him entirely. Joe
and I, being girls, pronounced it&mdash;horrid.</p>

<p>"Papa wants us to, you know," said May, who always sets us straight.</p>

<p>Jack, who had recently joined one of the college societies, moved that
the Professor be cordially supported. "His lecture last week was
exceedingly entertaining," he argued. "That he should be so good as to
come here and talk to us about his wonderful science in a pleasant
familiar way, simply because he's papa's old friend, shows the interest
he takes in the family."</p>

<p>"Do hush, Jack."</p>

<p>"My dear sister, I can not. What the Professor has to tell us about the
heavenly bodies&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I hate the heavenly bodies," growls Gus.</p>

<p>"Is it jealousy, Augustus, because they are allowed to stay out late
nights, while you are not?"</p>

<p>"Whatever it is, I agree with him," puts in Joe, who always stands by
Gus. "I hate astronomy too."</p>

<p>"Feeling as I do, Josephine, that your knowledge in the science is
confined to 'Twinkle, twinkle, little star,' and the fact that 'the moon
is made of green cheese,' I am surprised at you."</p>

<p>"What makes them twinkle?" asked May.</p>

<p>The Professor heard this, for he was just coming up stairs.</p>

<p>"What makes them twinkle, May?" and the Professor seated himself in an
easy-chair, as if ready to talk.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Sir. Won't you please tell us?"</p>

<p>"Pooh, May, don't bother the Professor with such juvenile questions.
He'll think he's intrusted with the charge of the third form in an
infant school."</p>

<p>"But," persisted May, "I would like very much to know, and I don't
believe you can tell, if you <i>have</i> been to college. Now there!"</p>

<p>Jack was somewhat nonplussed at this, but after a moment's hesitation
said, "Well, anyhow, the books I studied never told anything about the
stars twinkling, and I don't believe they do twinkle. It's nothing but a
baby notion."</p>

<p>All eyes are now intently fixed upon the Professor, who is expected
first to settle the fact, and then to account for it.</p>

<p>"You, Jack, who have been to college," he began, "know that all vision
or sight is produced by rays falling upon the eyes. These rays may be
broken or turned from their natural course&mdash;the word astronomers use is
refracted. Now the stars are so far away from us that through the
largest telescope they are still only points of light. As the rays come
down through space there is nothing to break or refract them, but when
they reach our atmosphere, there is the tremulous agitation of the air
and ascending vapors. By these the rays coming from the tiny points are
at intervals turned aside from the narrow space of the pupil of the eye.
When the eye is assisted with the wide opening of the object-glass of a
telescope no such thing happens. So Jack is right; the stars don't
twinkle. When viewed through a telescope, they are found to shine with a
steady brightness, and hence the motion is only in appearance. Recent
astronomers have little to say about it; but it is due, doubtless, as
Sir Isaac Newton explains in his celebrated <i>Principia</i>, to the
ascending vapors and tremulous movements of the atmosphere. You have
seen how the heated air or gas rising from a stove will sometimes make
things behind it tremble and dance. Now if a small candle were burning
on the other side of the ascending vapor, its flame, though really
steady, would seem to flicker."</p>

<p>"Then, Sir, the stars, being so very far off, appear so very little, and
the rays of light they send are disturbed by atmospheric vapor, and thus
to the naked eye they twinkle."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Professor. "The sun and moon, as you know, present broad
disks, with light radiating from every point&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please, Professor," interrupted May, "tell us what a 'disk' is. Jack's
big words are dreadful to understand; and this, although a little one,
seems just as bad."</p>

<p>"I don't wonder I puzzled you, May. We use the word disk for the face or
surface of a heavenly body which appears to have some size. You may
always stop me when I use a word you don't understand; but when I have
once told you, I shall want you to remember; for we can not know much
about science unless we learn some of the hard words. I was saying that
the sun and moon present broad disks, so that if some of the light is
intercepted, the eye does not notice the loss. The same is true also of
the planets, which appear large when they are magnified, but not of the
stars, owing to their immense distances; and when the impurities in the
atmosphere obscure or divert the narrow line of light they send to us,
the eye perceives it at once. Some of the stars appear very brilliant
through the large telescopes, but the light still seems to proceed from
a single point. There are some four or five thousand stars that can be
seen without a telescope."</p>

<span class="caption">THE GREAT EQUATORIAL, UNITED STATES NATIONAL
OBSERVATORY.</span>
</div>

<p>"Why," interrupted Joe, "I thought there were more than anybody could
count."</p>

<p>"So there are," replied the Professor, "but the number that can be
distinctly perceived by the unassisted eye is found to be comparatively
small when they are carefully looked after. On very clear nights the
whole sky may seem to glisten when the eye is suddenly turned upward;
and there are some portions of it where a confused light comes from a
sort of star-cloud, which has received the name of 'Milky Way.' But the
stars that can be seen separately are very easily counted. Some persons
can see rather more than others, on account of their eye-sight being
naturally better, or improved by use. A rough count of the number that
could be seen through Herschel's famous telescope made it twenty
thousand. The great telescopes more recently made would probably show as
many as forty or fifty millions."</p>

<p>"I should think," said May, "that it would be awful tiresome to count so
many things just alike, and that the man would often count the same one
over and over without knowing it, and would never be sure that he had
counted right."</p>

<p>"They are not all alike," said the Professor. "They differ greatly in
brightness, and to some extent in color, and in other particulars. They
have been divided according to their brilliancy into sixteen classes or
magnitudes. The fifteen brightest stars are said to be of the first
magnitude, the fifty next of the second, and so on to the sixth, which
comprises the faintest stars visible to the unassisted eye. The
brightest star of all visible in our latitude is the dogstar, which
gives four times as much light as any other. In every age of the world
there have been learned men interested enough in the stars to make
catalogues of them, giving their magnitudes and their positions."</p>

<p>"I think they must have been very slow and stupid follows," said Gus,
"or they would have found something better to do."</p>

<p>At this the Professor laughed.</p>

<p>"I think, Gus, you are hungry, and have your mind on mutton-chops. I
shall not talk to you any more this morning; but, after lunch, if you
will look in one of the great books in papa's library, which he will
point out, you will find pictures of all the great telescopes in the
world. The best one in our own country is that at the United States
National Observatory at Washington. Without the aid of these wonderful
instruments we should never have learned much about the stars."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_HISTORY_OF_PHOTOGEN_AND_NYCTERIS" id="THE_HISTORY_OF_PHOTOGEN_AND_NYCTERIS"></a>THE HISTORY OF PHOTOGEN AND NYCTERIS.</h2>

<h4>A Day and Night M&auml;hrchen.</h4>

<h3>By GEORGE MACDONALD.</h3>

<h3>I.&mdash;WATHO.</h3>

<p>There was once a witch who desired to know everything. But the wiser a
witch is, the harder she knocks her head against the wall when she comes
to it. Her name was Watho, and she had a wolf in her mind. She cared for
nothing in itself&mdash;only for knowing it. She was not naturally cruel, but
the wolf had made her cruel.</p>

<p>She was tall and graceful, with a white skin, red hair, and black eyes,
which had a red fire in them. She was straight and strong, but now and
then would fall bent together, shudder, and sit for a moment with her
head turned over her shoulder, as if the wolf had got out of her mind on
to her back.</p>

<h3>II.&mdash;AURORA.</h3>

<p>This witch got two ladies to visit her. One of them belonged to the
court, and her husband had been sent on a far and difficult embassy. The
other was a young widow whose husband had lately died, and who had since
lost her sight. Watho lodged them in different parts of her castle, and
they did not know of each other's existence.</p>

<p>The castle stood on the side of a hill sloping gently down into a narrow
valley, in which was a river, with a pebbly channel and a continual
song.</p>

<p>The garden went down to the bank of the river, inclosed by high walls,
which crossed the river, and there stopped. Each wall had a double row
of battlements, and between the rows was a narrow walk.</p>

<p>In the topmost story of the castle the Lady Aurora occupied a spacious
apartment of several large rooms looking southward. The windows
projected oriel-wise over the garden below, and there was a splendid
view from them both up and down and across the river. The opposite side
of the valley was steep, but not very high. Far away snow peaks were
visible. These rooms Aurora seldom left, but their airy spaces, the
brilliant landscape and sky, the plentiful sunlight, the musical
instruments, books, pictures, curiosities, with the company of Watho,
who made herself charming, precluded all dullness. She had venison and
feathered game to eat, milk and pale sunny sparkling wine to drink.</p>

<p>She had hair of the yellow gold, waved and rippled; her skin was fair,
not white like Watho's, and her eyes were of the blue of the heavens
when bluest; her features were delicate but strong, her mouth large and
finely curved, and haunted with smiles.</p>

<h3>III.&mdash;VESPER.</h3>

<p>Behind the castle the hill rose abruptly; the northeastern tower,
indeed, was in contact with the rock, and communicated with the interior
of it. For in the rock was a series of chambers, known only to Watho and
the one servant whom she trusted, called Falca. Some former owner had
constructed these chambers after the tomb of an Egyptian king, and
probably with the same design, for in the centre of one of them stood
what could only be a sarcophagus, but that and others were walled off.
The sides and roofs of them were carved in low relief, and curiously
painted. Here the witch lodged the blind lady, whose name was Vesper.
Her eyes were black, with long black lashes; her skin had a look of
darkened silver, but was of purest tint and grain; her hair was black
and fine and straight-flowing; her features were exquisitely formed, and
if less beautiful, yet more lovely from sadness; she always looked as if
she wanted to lie down and not rise again. She did not know she was
lodged in a tomb, though now and then she wondered she never touched a
window. There were many couches, covered with richest silk, and soft as
her own cheek, for her to lie upon; and the carpets were so thick she
might have cast herself down anywhere&mdash;as befitted a tomb. The place was
dry and warm, and cunningly pierced for air, so that it was always
fresh, and lacked only sunlight. There the witch fed her upon milk, and
wine dark as a carbuncle, and pomegranates, and purple grapes, and birds
that dwell in marshy places; and she played to her mournful tunes, and
caused wailful violins to attend her, and told her sad tales, thus
holding her ever in an atmosphere of sweet sorrow.</p>

<h3>IV.&mdash;PHOTOGEN.</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 329px;">
<img src="images/ill_005.jpg" width="329" height="400" alt="&quot;ALL DAY HE BASKED IN THE FULL SPLENDOR OF THE SUN.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;ALL DAY HE BASKED IN THE FULL SPLENDOR OF THE SUN.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>The witch at length had her desire, for witches often get what they
want: a splendid boy was born to the fair Aurora. Just as the sun rose,
he opened his eyes. Watho carried him immediately to a distant part of
the castle, and persuaded the mother that he never cried but once, dying
the moment he was born. Overcome with grief, Aurora left the castle as
soon as she was able, and Watho never invited her again.</p>

<p>And now the witch's care was that the child should not know darkness.
Persistently she trained him, until at last he never slept during the
day, and never woke during the night. She never let him see anything
black, and even kept all dull colors out of his way. Never, if she could
help it, would she let a shadow fall upon him, watching against shadows
as if they had been live things that would hurt him. All day he basked
in the full splendor of the sun, in the same large rooms his mother had
occupied. Watho used him to the sun until he could bear more of it than
any dark-skinned African. In the hottest of every day she stripped him
and laid him in it, that he might ripen like a peach; and the boy
rejoiced in it, and would resist being dressed again. She brought all
her knowledge to bear on making his muscles strong and elastic and
swiftly responsive&mdash;that his soul, she said, laughing, might sit in
every fibre, be all in every part, and awake the moment of call. His
hair was of the red gold, but his eyes grew darker as he grew, until
they were as black as Vesper's. He was the merriest of creatures, always
laughing, always loving, for a moment raging, then laughing afresh.
Watho called him Photogen.</p>

<h3>V.&mdash;NYCTERIS.</h3>

<p>Five or six months after the birth of Photogen, the dark lady also gave
birth to a baby: in the windowless tomb of a blind mother, in the dead
of night, under the feeble rays of a lamp in an alabaster globe, a girl
came into the darkness with a wail. And just as she was born for the
first time, Vesper was born for the second and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> passed into a world as
unknown to her as this was to her child&mdash;who would have to be born yet
again before she could see her mother.</p>

<p>Watho called her Nycteris, and she grew as like Vesper as possible&mdash;in
all but one particular. She had the same dark skin, dark eyelashes and
brows, dark hair, and gentle, sad look; but she had just the eyes of
Aurora, the mother of Photogen, and if they grew darker as she grew
older, it was only a darker blue. Watho, with the help of Falca, took
the greatest possible care of her&mdash;in every way consistent with her
plans, that is, the main point in which was that she should never see
any light but what came from the lamp. Hence her optic nerves, and
indeed her whole apparatus for seeing, grew both larger and more
sensitive; her eyes, indeed, stopped short only of being too large. She
was a sadly dainty little creature. No one in the world except those two
was aware of the being of the little bat. Watho trained her to sleep
during the day, and wake during the night. She taught her music, and
taught her scarcely anything else.</p>

<h3>VI.&mdash;HOW PHOTOGEN GREW.</h3>

<p>The hollow in which the castle of Watho lay was a cleft in a plain
rather than a valley among hills, for at the top of its steep sides,
both north and south, was a table-land large and wide. It was covered
with rich grass and flowers, with here and there a wood, the outlying
colony of a great forest. These grassy plains were the finest hunting
grounds in the world. The chief of Watho's huntsmen was a fine fellow,
and when Photogen began to outgrow the training she could give him, she
handed him over to Fargu. He with a will set about teaching him all he
knew. He got him pony after pony, larger and larger as he grew, every
one less manageable than that which had preceded it, and advanced him
from pony to horse, and from horse to horse, until he was equal to
anything in that kind which the country produced. In similar fashion he
trained him to the use of bow and arrow substituting every three months
a stronger bow and longer arrows, and soon he became, even on horseback,
a wonderful archer. Every day, almost as soon as the sun was up, he went
out hunting, and would in general be out nearly the whole of the day.
But Watho had laid upon Fargu just one commandment, namely, that
Photogen should on no account, whatever the plea, be out until sun-down,
or so near it as to wake in him the desire of seeing what was going to
happen; and this commandment Fargu was anxiously careful not to break;
for although he would not have trembled had a whole herd of bulls come
down upon him, charging at full speed across the level, and not an arrow
left in his quiver, he was more than afraid of his mistress. So that, as
Photogen grew older, Fargu began to tremble, for he found it steadily
growing harder to restrain him. He did not know what fear was, and that
not because he did not know danger; for he had had a severe laceration
from the razor-like tusk of a boar&mdash;whose spine, however, he had severed
with one blow of his hunting-knife before Fargu could reach him with
defense.</p>

<p>When the boy was approaching his sixteenth year, Fargu ventured to beg
of Watho that she would lay her commands upon the youth himself, and
release him from responsibility for him. One might as soon hold a
tawny-maned lion as Photogen, he said. Watho called the youth, laid her
command upon him never to be out when the rim of the sun should touch
the horizon, accompanying the prohibition with hints of consequences
none the less awful that they were obscure. Photogen listened
respectfully, but knowing neither the taste of fear nor the temptation
of the night, her words were but sounds to him.</p>

<h3>VII.&mdash;HOW NYCTERIS GREW.</h3>

<p>The little education she intended Nycteris to have, Watho gave her by
word of mouth. Not meaning she should have light enough to read by, she
never put a book in her hands. Nycteris, however, saw so much better
than Watho imagined, that the light she gave her was quite sufficient,
and she managed to coax Falca into teaching her the letters, after which
she taught herself to read, and Falca now and then brought her a child's
book. But her chief pleasure was in her instrument. Her very fingers
loved it, and would wander about over its keys like feeding sheep. She
was not unhappy. She knew nothing of the world except the tomb in which
she dwelt, and had some pleasure in everything she did. But she desired,
nevertheless, something more or different. She did not know what it was,
and the nearest she could come to expressing it to herself was&mdash;that she
wanted more room. Watho and Falca would go from her beyond the shine of
the lamp, and come again; therefore surely there must be more room
somewhere. As often as she was left alone she would fall to poring over
the colored bas-reliefs on the walls. These were intended to represent
various of the powers of Nature under allegorical similitudes, and as
nothing can be made that does not belong to the general scheme, she
could not fail at least to imagine a flicker of relationship between
some of them, and thus a shadow of the reality of things found its way
to her.</p>

<p>There was one thing, however, which moved and taught her more than all
the rest&mdash;the lamp, namely, that hung from the ceiling, which she always
saw alight, though she never saw the flame, only the slight condensation
toward the centre of the alabaster globe. And besides the operation of
the light itself after its kind, the indefiniteness of the globe, and
the softness of the light, giving her the feeling as if her eyes could
go in and into its whiteness, were somehow also associated with the idea
of space and room. She would sit for an hour together gazing up at the
lamp, and her heart would swell as she gazed. She would wonder what had
hurt her when she found her face wet with tears, and then would wonder
how she could have been hurt without knowing it. She never looked thus
at the lamp except when she was alone.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 1.&mdash;Rug.&mdash;[See Figs. 2-4.]</span>
</div>

<p>The pretty glove-case published in No. 2, November 11, was warmly
welcomed, and our young friends are eagerly clamoring for more holiday
gifts that they can make readily and cheaply. In compliance with their
wish we will occasionally furnish fancy articles that can be
manufactured by little hands. One of the most tasteful and useful
presents that we can suggest is a handsome canvas rug, which can be
easily made with the help of the accompanying pictures and description,
and which is sure to prove a successful Christmas gift. The rug is made
of &eacute;cru linen Java canvas, which, with the border, can be bought cheaply
in any large fancy store. The centre of the rug is twenty-eight inches
long and nineteen inches wide, and is embroidered in loop stitch with
claret-colored worsted. The border is four inches wide, and is worked in
cross stitch with similar worsted. That useful periodical, <i>Harper's
Bazar</i>, gives full directions for working these and many other stitches.
Almost every little girl, however, knows how to make these simple
stitches, or can find some one to show her. The rug is lined with gray
drilling, and edged with fringe, of which the illustration Fig. 4 shows
a full-sized section.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">

<span class="caption">Fig. 3.&mdash;Reel for Rug, Fig. 1.</span>
</div>

<p>To make the fringe first twist together threads of claret-colored
worsted. For this purpose use a wooden reel, the middle rod of which
forms a movable handle. One side of the reel is furnished with brass
hooks on the ends. Lay a thread of claret-colored worsted on the upper
hook as shown by Fig. 2; turn the reel quickly, holding the thread
double with the left hand and the handle of the reel with the right hand
until the thread has been twisted long enough to be wound on the reel,
with the hands in the position as shown by Fig. 3. When the threads have
been twisted of sufficient length, wind them tight on a long wooden
board four inches and seven-eighths in circumference (see Fig. 4), and
for the heading of the fringe crochet on each thread 1 sc. (single
crochet) with claret-colored worsted. Withdraw the board from the loops,
twist these, and on the sc. work a second round of sc. with similar
worsted, at the same time fastening in a chain stitch foundation worked
with &eacute;cru cotton. In doing this, work alternately 2 sc. on the
foundation and 2 sc. without the foundation.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 4.&mdash;Manner of making Fringe for Rug, Fig. 1.</span>
</div>

<p>Another simple fringe is made by winding the worsted on a suitable-sized
book, then cutting it through on one end, and knotting strands of four
threads each into the edge of the rug.</p>

<p><b>Electric Ornaments.</b>&mdash;Some curious trinkets, to which certain motions can
be given at will by means of electricity, have recently been devised by
an ingenious Frenchman, M. Trouv&eacute;. Two of these are scarf pins; one has
a death's-head, gold or enamel, with diamond eyes and lower articulated
jaw; the other has a rabbit seated upright on a box with a little bell
before it, to be struck with two rods held in the animal's fore-paws. An
invisible wire connects these objects with a small hermetically closed
battery, the ebonite case of which is about the size of a cigarette. It
is kept in the waistcoat pocket, and acts only when turned horizontally
or inverted. When a person looks at the pin, the owner, slipping a
finger into his pocket, moves the battery, whereupon the death's-head
rolls its eyes and grinds its teeth, or the little rabbit beats the bell
with its rods (through electro-magnetic action). A third kind of
ornament is a small bird set with diamonds, to be fixed in a lady's
hair, and the wings of which can be set in motion electrically.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><b>The Great Wall of China.</b>&mdash;An American engineer engaged in the
construction of a railway in China, gives the following account of this
wonderful work. The wall is 1728 miles long, 18 feet high, and 15 feet
thick at the top. The foundation throughout is of solid granite, the
remainder of compact masonry. At intervals of between two hundred and
three hundred yards towers rise up, twenty-five to thirty feet high, and
twenty-four feet in diameter. On the top of the wall and on both sides
of it are masonry parapets to enable the defenders to pass unseen from
one tower to another. The wall is carried from point to point in a
straight line, across valleys, plains, and hills, sometimes plunging
down into deep abysses. Rivers are bridged over by the wall, while on
both banks of large streams strong flanking towers are placed.</p>

<h2><a name="MARGOTTES_STORY" id="MARGOTTES_STORY"></a>MARGOTTE'S STORY.</h2>

<p>"I will tell you the story," said Margotte, pausing in her knitting, as
we leaned together over the white palings of her little garden. "Yes,
there is a story, madame&mdash;a story of a wolf; but you have got it wrong,
madame, and I must set you right."</p>

<p>Picture a sunset in the Pyrenees, a glorious crimson sky tipping the
distant peaks with pale pink, and deepening the purple shadows on the
nearer mountains&mdash;the mountains that inclose and overtop Margotte
Nevaire's pretty home. I had come for a quiet month to this picturesque,
secluded village, and though my month was over, I was tempted to linger
day after day, for the sake of the sunshine and the mountains, and not
least, perhaps, for the sake of these two peasant girls, with whom I
lodged.</p>

<p>Margotte was the youngest of the two by fifteen years&mdash;the three boys
who came between had died&mdash;and though it is very long since we leaned
side by side over the white palings, I can always call her to mind as
she stood knitting there.</p>

<p>She was tall and strong, and finely made, with a clear white skin, and
brown hair waving in heavy masses under her white starched caps. She had
beautiful eyes, heavy-lidded and dark-lashed, and a firm, sweet
mouth&mdash;such a woman as you see sometimes amongst the desolate mountains,
as if God had given to them a grander soul, to compensate for the
blessings He denied.</p>

<p>L&eacute;ontine was different; tall too, and active, but with heavier
movements, and more of firmness than of sweetness in her scarred face.
She had no girlish vanity in her glossy hair, or the cap starched to
such absolute perfection, for so much of her youth and beauty had
vanished with that scar&mdash;a deep blue line from brow to chin&mdash;that no
loving arrangement of the hair by Margotte's deft fingers could hide.</p>

<p>So Margotte said to me that evening,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> dropping her knitting into her
apron pocket: "I will tell you the story of the wolf, madame. L&eacute;ontine
is out, and it is a grand story&mdash;a story I should like you to hear."</p>

<p>"It was night," said Margotte, "a cruel, cold winter night, such as we
who live amongst the mountains have terrible cause to dread, for it
means hunger and cold&mdash;sometimes absolute famine. It means the children
crying for food when there is none to give them, and the wolves howling
in the distance. Ah! those wolves, madame, how they make one shudder
with their monotonous howls, that seem so near at first, and then die
away into the far distance!</p>

<p>"Well, it was night, as I have said, and the baby was asleep, as it
might be here, and L&eacute;ontine was knitting on the hearth, and Marcelle, a
friend of L&eacute;ontine's, was chattering to her, kneeling on the stones, and
the door was on the latch.</p>

<p>"That was the mischief, you see; but L&eacute;ontine was young then, and
Marcelle was a giddy, thoughtless chatterer, and she had run in with her
shawl over her head for an hour's talk. L&eacute;ontine has told me of it so
often that I almost seem to see the two girls crouching by the fire that
sent bright and flickering reflections on to the snow outside.</p>

<p>"Suddenly, as they talked, there came distinctly to them the howling of
the wolves across the snow. Marcelle put her hands over her ears and
shuddered. L&eacute;ontine knelt up and stirred the fire.</p>

<p>"'Come closer, my friend,' she said; 'it is a dreary sound. Thank God,
we are safe here!'</p>

<p>"'Are we safe, do you think?' asked Marcelle, with chattering teeth. 'I
dare not go home to-night. Will your mother let me stay here, L&eacute;ontine?'</p>

<p>"'Surely,' said Leontine.</p>

<p>"She was so brave, my sister, my dear, dear sister, madame, and so
gentle! she took Marcelle's head upon her knee, and put her knitting
aside to soothe her terror.</p>

<p>"'We are quite safe, Marcelle,' she said, 'and mother will soon be back.
It is a dreary night.'</p>

<p>"It <i>was</i> a dreary night, dark and still and terribly cold; the white
flakes were falling slowly to the earth, and covering the mother's
footsteps on the path.</p>

<p>"L&eacute;ontine walked over to the window and looked out; the fire-light was
dancing and flickering on the snow outside, and making a cheerful patch
of ruddy light in the darkness, which would guide the mother's steps for
her home-coming. Through the darkness the howling of the wolves seemed
nearer.</p>

<p>"'Ah, they are coming closer,' said Marcelle, starting upright. 'Can you
see them, L&eacute;ontine? I am afraid.'</p>

<p>"L&eacute;ontine was leaning close to the glass, pressing her face against it.</p>

<p>"'Yes, I see shadows,' she said; 'they are coming to the light,
Marcelle. No! it is only one shadow, after all; we must not frighten
each other.'</p>

<p>"She turned with a faint smile to Marcelle's shuddering face, and tried
to draw the curtains with her trembling hands, but the shadow on the
snow was very near.</p>

<p>"'Do not be afraid, my dear,' she said, kneeling down upon the hearth
again, and drawing Marcelle's cold hands into her own strong ones; 'be
brave; we are quite safe, you know; the door is strong, and God is so
good, Marcelle.'</p>

<p>"But Marcelle was sobbing.</p>

<p>"Her sobbing woke the baby, and it cried&mdash;little moaning cries that
fretted L&eacute;ontine, and that brought the dark shadow nearer to the door.</p>

<p>"L&eacute;ontine rocked the baby, but could not hush its wailing cries; she
knelt beside the cradle, singing her strange, weird songs in a voice
that never trembled, and all the time that foolish Marcelle was sobbing
and trembling at her feet.</p>

<p>"'Hush, for God's sake!' said L&eacute;ontine at last, lifting her clear eyes,
and trying to still the faltering of her voice. 'You frighten me,
Marcelle, and you keep baby fretful. Mother will soon be home, and the
night is not long, and we are quite safe, thank God.'</p>

<p>"But the words were still in her mouth when she heard a heavy shuffling
in the snow outside, and a terrible howl that seemed to shake the little
cottage to its foundations. Then&mdash;ah! think of it, madame&mdash;the
door&mdash;this door against which you lean&mdash;was burst open, and out of the
darkness a great wolf came bounding in, and paused for a minute on the
threshold.</p>

<p>"L&eacute;ontine was upright in an instant, standing before the cradle. Even
Marcelle rose also, and stood shrieking on the hearth.</p>

<p>"But the great, lean, hungry wolf came slinking on&mdash;and it passed
L&eacute;ontine, and took the little baby from the cradle.</p>

<p>"L&eacute;ontine had stood as if rooted to the spot, with her burning eyes
fascinated by the awful sight; but now she strode to the table, and took
a knife. And yet she dared not throw it, because of the baby, madame.</p>

<p>"They seemed so helpless all of a sudden, those two girls, while the
great beast crept past them again, trotting to the door. Marcelle had
taken a fagot from the fire, and cast it at him, but he only shook it
off, and growled savagely, bounding out into the snow.</p>

<p>"Ah, madame, it was terrible&mdash;terrible; and yet, as L&eacute;ontine always
says, God is good.</p>

<p>"For while Marcelle was crying by the empty cradle, and the snow was
sweeping into the room and putting out the fire, L&eacute;ontine had sprung to
the door, and had flung herself to the ground, with her brave white face
not two inches from the wolf's glaring eyes; she stretched out her hands
and caught him by his shaggy coat, twisting her strong fingers into his
matted hair. She still held her knife firmly, but she dared not use it.</p>

<p>"She succeeded in her wish, madame, however; the wolf was surprised and
angry. With a low, fierce growl, that made Marcelle's heart beat to
suffocation, he dropped the baby.</p>

<p>"L&eacute;ontine has told me often that she never knows how she came living out
of that terrible struggle; she says she remembers crying aloud to God to
keep the baby safe, and to take the life she offered up so willingly
instead. She remembers striking with her knife at the great body that
fell upon her, blinding and suffocating her; then there came to her ears
a dim faint sound like music, and my cries&mdash;<i>I</i> was the baby, you have
guessed, madame&mdash;and then silence, such silence as L&eacute;ontine says she
thinks will be like the silence of death.</p>

<p>"But it was not death. Ah, no&mdash;there is L&eacute;ontine, you see, coming up
with her pitcher from the well; and the wolf, the last wolf killed in
St. Priv&acirc;t, lies buried not a foot from where we stand; but L&eacute;ontine
will carry her trophy of victory to her dying day. Some people say that
her face would be very beautiful but for the scar; but for me, madame, I
think that it is the scar that makes her face so beautiful."</p>

<p>Our young friends must not be impatient if their communications are not
noticed immediately. Our space is limited, and we answer or print
letters in the order in which they are received. The following pleasant
note comes from a young correspondent in Paterson:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear "Young People</span>,"&mdash;If all the boys and girls were as glad to see
you as I was, you must have received a very flattering welcome. We
have felt the want of a cheap, first-class weekly paper so much
that we are able to appreciate you now that we have you. There are
several weeklies published for the "young," but the great objection
to them is that half are too dry, and the other half too
sensational. You are neither, but very interesting.</p></div>

there is no limit to the age of our contributors.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><span class="smcap">Lyman C.</span>&mdash;Your land-turtle will eat pieces of pear or sweet apple,
bread, cake, and many other things. It will also live many months
without eating at all. You can keep it in a box, and it will be happier
if you give it a little earth to dig in. If the earth is deep enough, it
will make a burrow and sleep in it until next spring. We knew a little
girl who received a present of two land-turtles, which she placed in the
yard. In a few days she was unable to find them, and gave them up for
lost. The next spring, six months afterward, she was digging in her
flower beds, when, to her astonishment, she found her two lost pets, who
opened their eyes on being disturbed, and crawled sluggishly out of
their hole. They had been asleep all through the cold weather, for
turtles are very long lived, and they can easily give a whole winter to
a single nap. Rev. Mr. Wood, in a note to White's <i>Natural History of
Selborne</i>, gives a very interesting account of a tame turtle which he
allowed to crawl about his study. This turtle showed a great genius for
climbing, and at one time actually succeeded in scrambling upon a
footstool. He says: "Its food consisted of bread and milk, which it ate
several times a day, drinking the milk by scooping up some of it in its
lower jaw, and then by throwing its head back the milk ran down its
throat."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Young Chemist</span>.&mdash;Spread on your paper first a solution of iodide of
potassium, then a solution of nitrate of silver. Iodide of silver forms,
and saturates the paper. The excess of nitrate of silver and the heavy
yellow powder which forms are now washed off, and the paper is ready for
the camera. The picture may be developed by a solution of gallic acid
mixed with a very small quantity of an aqueous solution of acetic acid
and nitrate of silver. The picture is fixed by washing with hyposulphite
of soda. If you wish to derive any pleasure from photography, you would
better drop the old-fashioned paper process, and turn your attention to
ferrotypes, or negatives on glass, as with them good results are more
easily obtained than with paper.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 11em;">Six little people out for a walk;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">They would let you know where, if they only could talk.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 11em;">Three tabbies took out their cats to tea,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">As well-behaved tabbies as well could be:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">Each sat in the chair that each preferred,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">They mewed for their milk, and they sipped and purred.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">Now tell me this (as these cats you've seen them)&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">How many lives had these cats between them?</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 17em;">Yes, it is sad of them&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Shocking to me;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">Bad&mdash;yes, it's bad of them&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Bad of all three.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">Warnings they've had from me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Still I repeat them&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">Cold is the water&mdash;the</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Fishes will eat them;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 17em;">Yet they will row about;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Tho' I say "Fie!" to them;</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 14em;">Will you be my little wife,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">If I ask you? Do!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">I'll buy you such a Sunday frock,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">A nice umbrella too.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And you shall have a little hat,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">With such a long white feather,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">A pair of gloves, and sandal shoes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">The softest kind of leather.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">And you shall have a tiny house,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">A bee-hive full of bees,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">A little cow, a largish cat,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">And green sage cheese.</span><br />
